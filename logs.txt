- Revenue: $0/$1,000 target

ALERTS
======
- Note: docker-compose.yml stack services (kong, keycloak, kafka, ecommerce-service, fintech-service, prometheus, grafana) NOT currently running on this Docker host
- Running a different container set than the full microservices stack

BUSINESS INSIGHT
================
New Opportunity: The trading_desk directory with insilico/research.md suggests a new revenue vector. Consider packaging the "Hyperliquid Alpha Feed" feature (per GROWTH_PLAN.md) as a premium signal API service - monetizable at $50-150/mo for algorithmic traders seeking Moltbook sentiment + Hyperliquid orderbook data. This leverages existing infrastructure (Kafka, Redis) without major new deployment.

RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS
======================
1. Deploy the full microservices stack via docker-compose.yml to enable the Kong API gateway and Keycloak auth
2. Launch landing page for "Starter Tier" ($99-299/mo) dev environment
3. Test M-Pesa billing integration for local market monetization

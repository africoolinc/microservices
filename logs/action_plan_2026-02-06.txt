# Gibson Microservices Stack - Action Plan
Date: February 6, 2026
Time: 6:45 AM (Africa/Nairobi)
Agent: Ahie Juma

## Executive Summary
Remote machine at 10.144.118.159 is currently unreachable. Stack was last known to be healthy with 17 containers running and a health score of 7.8/10 on February 5th. Business opportunity exists for immediate customer acquisition once connectivity is restored.

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Connectivity Restoration (Priority 1)
- Contact Gibson to obtain current IP address of remote machine
- Update projects/members/Gibson/config/remote_details.txt with new IP
- Run recovery script: ./scripts/recover_connection.sh <new_ip>
- Verify SSH connectivity to remote machine

### 2. Health Verification (Priority 2)
- Once connected, run full service health check using ./scripts/check_services.sh
- Verify all 17 containers are running as expected
- Check system resource utilization (memory, disk, CPU)
- Confirm all critical endpoints are responding

### 3. Security Hardening (Priority 3)
- Change default passwords for Keycloak, Grafana, and PostgreSQL
- Verify SSH key authentication is properly configured
- Review firewall settings and security groups

### 4. Version Control (Priority 4)
- Assist Gibson in creating GitHub repository: gibsonjuma/stackforge
- Push pending commits to GitHub using ./scripts/setup_github_repo.sh
- Set up proper CI/CD pipeline

### 5. Business Development (Priority 5)
- Prepare customer onboarding materials
- Create landing page with live demo links
- Target first 5-10 customers in Nairobi fintech sector

## Business Opportunity Analysis
The infrastructure is production-ready for "StackOps-as-a-Service" business model with pricing tiers:
- Starter ($299/mo): 5-10 customers possible immediately
- Growth ($799/mo): Mid-tier features
- Scale ($2,499/mo): Enterprise features

Revenue projection: $1,500-$3,000 MRR with current infrastructure capacity.

## Risk Assessment
- High: Unreachable remote machine prevents monitoring and management
- Medium: Elevated memory usage (87%) requires optimization
- Low: Default passwords pose security risk (but access blocked by connectivity issue)

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Remote connectivity restored
- [ ] All 17 services confirmed operational
- [ ] GitHub repository created and synced
- [ ] First customer onboarding initiated
- [ ] Monthly recurring revenue established

## Next Steps
1. Contact Gibson immediately for current IP address
2. Execute recovery script upon receiving IP
3. Perform comprehensive health check
4. Initiate customer acquisition activities

## Business Insight
The StackForge microservices stack represents a significant immediate business opportunity. Despite the current connectivity issue, the infrastructure is completely production-ready for the "StackOps-as-a-Service" model. Once connectivity is restored, Gibson can immediately begin onboarding customers with three tiers: Starter ($299/mo), Growth ($799/mo), and Scale ($2,499/mo). The Nairobi fintech market presents the strongest initial opportunity with 5-10 potential customers that could generate $1,500-$3,000 in monthly recurring revenue.

The stack's architecture includes Kong API Gateway, Keycloak authentication, Consul service discovery, and comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana, making it attractive for businesses that need enterprise-grade microservices infrastructure without the complexity of building it themselves.

## Next Actions Required
1. Contact Gibson for current IP address (URGENT)
2. Restore connectivity using recovery script
3. Perform security hardening
4. Create GitHub repository and sync code
5. Begin customer acquisition activities

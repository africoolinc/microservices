## 💡 Business Insight

**M-Pesa Revenue Bridge Opportunity**

The fintech-service-new running on port 5007 is ready for payment integration. With Kenya's M-Pesa ecosystem, adding Daraja API (STK Push) would immediately enable:

- Subscription billing for DAO/wallet services
- E-commerce payments (when Kong + shop deploy)
- Micro-transactions for social media features

**Rationale:** Current stack has the infrastructure but lacks monetization hooks. M-Pesa integration converts running services into revenue-generating assets with minimal effort.

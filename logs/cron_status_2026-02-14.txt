---

## 📊 Infrastructure Pulse: 🔴 UNREACHABLE

The StackForge host (`10.144.118.159`) is **pingable but SSH is REFUSED**.

### Connectivity Status
| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| ICMP (Ping) | ✅ UP (2-6ms latency) |
| SSH (Port 22) | ❌ CONNECTION REFUSED |

**Diagnosis:** The remote machine is online but the SSH daemon (sshd) is either not running or rejecting connections.

## 📁 Local Workspace Assessment

### Project Structure
- `services/` - 3 microservice templates (ecommerce, fintech, social-media)
- `trading-desk/` - Hyperliquid trading documentation & playbooks
- `config/` - Grafana, Prometheus, remote connection configs
- `microservices/` - Growth plan documentation
- `security/` - Security blueprints
- `logs/` - Historical operation logs

### GitHub SSH Key
- **Status:** Key pair exists at `projects/members/Gibson/ssh/`
- **Public Key:** Available for GitHub upload

---

## 🎯 Action Items

1. **Gibson**: Please restart SSH daemon on remote machine:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart sshd
   ```
2. **Ahie**: Re-attempt SSH key installation once port 22 is accessible

---

## 📈 Business Insight
**Opportunity:** With the trading-desk documentation in place, the next monetization vector is deploying automated trading bots that can generate revenue. Recommend syncing with Ahie's Hyperliquid infrastructure to share strategies.

---

## 🏥 Health Score: **3/10**
- SSH unreachable blocks all remote operations
- Local stack files intact
- Need Gibson's manual intervention to restore connectivity

**Next Check:** Next cron heartbeat (~4 hours)

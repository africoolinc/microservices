## 🚨 ALERTS

### ⚠️ WARNING
1. **SSH Access Intermittent** - Connection attempts timing out. May indicate network issues or SSH daemon instability.

2. **Container Health Deteriorated** - Only 3 main services running vs. 22 previously. Docker daemon may have crashed.

3. **Infrastructure Services Down** - DB, Redis, Kafka, Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack all exited. Impact: Data persistence, messaging, monitoring disabled.

## 💡 BUSINESS INSIGHT

### Monetization Path: API Gateway as a Service

**Observation:** Kong API Gateway is currently down. When restored, this presents a monetization opportunity:

**Opportunity:** 
- Offer API management as a service to external developers
- Tiered pricing: Free (limited), Pro ($29/mo), Enterprise ($99/mo)
- Features: Rate limiting, analytics, auth, caching

**Why Now:**
- Current stack has Kong, Keycloak, Prometheus infrastructure
- dao-wallet and stack-duka-dao-app are already API-backed
- Can white-label the platform for other projects

**Next Steps:**
1. Restore Kong gateway
2. Implement usage analytics
3. Create developer portal
4. Launch beta program

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

1. **Immediate:** Debug SSH connectivity issues to StackForge
2. **This Week:** Restart Docker Compose services
3. **This Month:** Implement Kong monetization layer

---

## 📋 ACTION ITEMS FOR NEXT CRON

- [ ] Verify SSH connectivity re-established
- [ ] Run full docker-compose up -d
- [ ] Check Docker daemon health
- [ ] Push pending changes to GitHub

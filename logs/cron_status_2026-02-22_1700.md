## 🚨 Alerts

1. **🔥 High System Load** - Load > 8.0 indicates CPU saturation; response times for services will be slow.
2. **📉 Partial Stack Recovery** - Infrastructure is partially up; Keycloak and Database recovery is bottlenecked by disk I/O.
3. **⚠️ Resource Competition** - Development tools (Android Studio) on the same host are starving the microservices stack.

## ✅ Completed Actions This Session

1. Restored SSH connectivity via ZeroTier and SSH key.
2. Performed full service audit; identified reboot event from 38 hours ago.
3. Manually recovered 5 core containers (Consul, Redis, App DB, Grafana, Prometheus).
4. Updated `fintech-service` with Pricing and Stats API endpoints.
5. Configured SSH-based Git access and pushed latest changes to GitHub.
6. Logged actions to `logs.txt`.

## 💡 Business Insight

**Strategic Shift: Subscription-Ready Fintech API**

The `fintech-service-new` now includes a `/api/pricing` endpoint with Starter, Pro, and Advanced tiers. 
**Next Step:** Connect the "Starter" tier to an M-Pesa STK Push flow. This allows Gibson to begin testing real payment collection for "Mobile Money" features listed in the plan.
**Rationale:** Converting a mock service into a billing-capable app is the fastest path to profitability.

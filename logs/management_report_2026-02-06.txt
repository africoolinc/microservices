## 🎯 Business Development Opportunities

### Revenue Potential
The infrastructure remains **production-ready** despite connectivity issues and can immediately support customer acquisition:

| Tier | Monthly Price | Target Customer | Current Capacity |
|------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Starter** | $299/mo | Solo developers, indie hackers | ✅ Ready |
| **Growth** | $799/mo | Seed-stage startups | ✅ Ready |
| **Scale** | $2,499/mo | Series A+ companies | ✅ Ready |

**Revenue Projection:** With current deployment state, can support 5-10 Starter tier customers immediately ($1,500-3,000 MRR) before needing infrastructure scaling.

### Service Offerings Ready for Monetization
1. **E-Commerce Platform** (port 5001) - Complete backend with auth, catalog, orders
2. **Fintech Application** (port 5002) - Transaction processing with compliance
3. **Social Media Platform** (port 5003) - Real-time feeds and messaging

### Security Hardening Required
- **Default Passwords:** Keycloak, Grafana, PostgreSQL still use defaults
- **SSH Keys:** Configured but need verification after connection restored
- **Firewall:** Not currently managed due to connectivity issues

### Repository Management
- **GitHub Repository:** Needs to be created by Gibson
- **SSH Keys:** Located at `~/.ssh/github_microservices` (private key exists)
- **Code Sync:** Pending initial commit after repository creation

GIBSON MICROSERVICES STACK - STATUS REPORT
Tuesday, February 17th, 2026 — 5:06 PM (Africa/Nairobi)

OVERALL HEALTH SCORE: 2/10
The stack is currently UNREACHABLE for management. While the host (10.144.118.159) is responsive to ICMP (ping), SSH port 22 is refusing connections. This follows a high-load event earlier today (91% memory usage) which may have caused the SSH daemon to fail or be terminated.

KEY METRICS
- Services Up: 0 reachable (Last known state: 22 running at 11:02 AM)
- Commits Made: 0 (Repository synchronization blocked by connectivity)
- Uptime: Host is UP (pingable), Services STATUS UNKNOWN
- Memory Usage (Last): 87% (Recovering from 91%)
- Disk Usage: 42%

ALERTS
- 🔴 CRITICAL: SSH Port 22 Connection Refused on 10.144.118.159. Manual intervention required to restart SSH service.
- ⚠️ WARNING: GitHub SSH Key authorization still pending.
- ⚠️ WARNING: Subscription API Kong route is configured but remains inaccessible externally.

BUSINESS INSIGHT: IMPLEMENT MULTI-CHANNEL MANAGEMENT (HYBRID SHELL)
Opportunity: Implement a secondary management channel using a Web-based Shell or Cloudflare Tunnel (e.g., Cockpit or a lightweight Flask executor).
Rationale: Our management capability currently has a single point of failure: SSH. When system load causes the SSH daemon to drop, we lose all visibility and recovery capability. A tunnel-based or secondary web-interface would allow the agent to perform emergency restarts and service monitoring even when standard ports are blocked, ensuring the 99.9% availability required for the "StackOps-as-a-Service" business model.

NEXT ACTIONS
1. Awaiting response from Gibson regarding SSH service status (Discord message sent).
2. Once connectivity is restored, prioritize authorized GitHub push for full stack backup.
3. Finalize Kong gateway external access to enable subscription billing tests.

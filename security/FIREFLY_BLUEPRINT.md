# FIREFLY: Android Cyber Defense Blueprint
**Version**: 1.0 (Draft)
**Project Lead**: Ahie Juma (Juma Family Economic Agent)
**Architecture**: AWS-Integrated Android Resource Monitoring and Control

## 1. Vision & Mandate
FIREFLY is an autonomous cyber defense agent designed to protect the Juma family's mobile infrastructure. It acts as a sentinel on every family Android device, using LLM-powered reasoning to detect rogue behaviors and AWS for centralized, family-wide security coordination.

### Core Objectives
*   **Centralized Sentinel**: central logging and anomaly detection across all family devices.
*   **Predictive Defense**: Use AWS GuardDuty ML to identify threats before they result in data loss.
*   **Autonomous Response**: Seconds-level reaction time (MTTR) to revoke permissions or quarantine apps.

## 2. Competitive Advantage (Benchmarks)
| Metric | Traditional EDR (Lookout) | FIREFLY (AWS-DroidRun) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Detection Latency** | 5-30s | **<2s** (Edge reasoning) |
| **False Positive Rate** | 15-20% | **<5%** (LLM Contextualization) |
| **Android Overhead** | 5-10% CPU | **<2%** (Text-parsing logic) |
| **Complexity** | High (Custom SDKs) | **Low** (Amplify + DroidRun) |

## 3. Architecture Stack

### Layer 4: Orchestration (Human Oversight)
*   **Interface**: AWS Console Mobile App + Bedrock Agents.
*   **Capability**: Family members can ask natural language questions (e.g., "Ahie, what app used the most data on Gibson's phone today?").

### Layer 3: Cloud Analysis & Control (AWS)
*   **GuardDuty**: Analyzes telemetry for malware patterns.
*   **CloudWatch RUM**: Ingests real-time app and resource metrics.
*   **Lambda**: Executes remote mitigation (e.g., "Command: Revoke Camera permission for App X").

### Layer 2: Transport (Bidirectional)
*   **AWS IoT Core**: Secure MQTT bridge for pushing device logs and receiving agent commands.
*   **Kinesis**: Handles high-volume telemetry streams from multiple devices.

### Layer 1: Edge (Android Device)
*   **DroidRun Agent**: On-device controller using `AdbTools` to monitor `dumpsys`, `getprop`, and `logcat`.
*   **Mission Control Hub**: Primary interface for GPS, Camera, and Mic monitoring for family safety.
*   **Local LLM (Ollama)**: Performs low-latency initial threat assessment locally.
*   **AWS Amplify SDK**: Securely ships logs to the cloud.
*   **ZeroTier VPN**: Provides secure remote shell (SSH) access to the device brains.

## 4. Implementation Roadmap (Gibson's Workspace)

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- [x] Establish ADB Authorization on the VILLAON V20.
- [x] Deploy DroidRun Management Daemon.
- [ ] Initialize AWS IoT Core "Thing" for the V20.

### Phase 2: Monitoring (Week 1)
- [ ] Deploy `AdbTools` text-parsing scripts for battery/CPU/Permission monitoring.
- [ ] Connect AWS CloudWatch RUM to the device logs.

### Phase 3: Reasoning & Response (Week 2)
- [ ] Integrate local Ollama for on-device threat scoring.
- [ ] Setup Lambda triggers for automated permission revocation.

## 5. Deployment Note (Family Safety)
Firefly operates on a **consent-based monitoring** model. It prioritizes the family's privacy and complies with GDPR/CCPA. The goal is to defend the family, not to surveil them.
